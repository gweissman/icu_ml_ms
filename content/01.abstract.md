Traditional statistical modeling approaches are usually compared to machine learning methods using large, retrospective datasets. 
Their relative performance across manual and automated methods, how approaches to missing data, use of repeated measures across time, and split-sampling approaches, when applied to small, prospectively collected datasets is unknown.
We sought to address these questions using a small ($N=Z$), prospectively collected data from patients admitted to an intensive care unit.
Therefore, we compared multivariable logistic regression, penalized logistic regression, XGBoost, TPOT-1, TPOT-2, and Feat approaches to model tuning and selection. Each model received three different datasets with varying strategies for handling missing data, including prior imputation, inclusion of missing fields, and complete cases analysis.
Each model variably received data from the first and second day of inlusion in the cohort.
Each model also received 80/20 and 50/50 split samples or training and testing.
We found that...
