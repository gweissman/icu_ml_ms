## Results

For the primary analysis, testing a six-month mortality prediction using one day of data, an 80/20 split, and an individualized imputation strategy, the traditional logistic regression model yielded the highest point estimate of performance, although did not differ statistically ($p>0.08$ for all comparisons; Figure {@fig:brier_scores}).
